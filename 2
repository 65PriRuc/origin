					<h3>Hello, and welcome to the Beginner's Guide...</h3>

		<p>To the musicians, creators, inventors, and all those alike, let us begin with a scenario. Imagine you're on a stage. <i>You</i> facing
		all the world. You have 60 seconds to prove your skill, whether it be through a performance, your newest invention, your artwork, etc. And
		this is the moment-the moment when you either make it or break it. Seven billion people watching-waiting for you to make your mark on the
		world through this one moment.
<div id="poll">
		<FORM METHOD=”post” ACTION="server_file_to_process_form_data">
			<B>Could you do it?</p></B><P>

		<p>Perhaps you said yes. Perhaps the pressure wouldn't get to your head, and those 60 seconds would be the best of your life. You'd be sure
		of it. But how many of you said no? If not the majority, then perhaps your fellow readers are lying. I know. And it's okay to be honest
		here. Not as though I know whose answer belongs to whom specifically, but do it for the honest nature towards yourself.</p>
		<p>Because if you're a creator or artist or inventor of some sort, you understand the pressure, not only that the world puts on you, but that
		you put on yourself. And even without being on a true stage before seven billion people, you know what it's like to get welled up inside
		with the intensity and frustration of creation. To become flustered with the thought that you're not good enough, and to become so enthralled
		in your art that it becomes your life-</p>
		<p>But let me tell you this. The creation is <i>not</i> the creator. Which just so happens to be one thing we lose sight of. No matter how much
		a creation reflects us, it shouldn't become us. But no matter how much the creation may become exposed to the public eye, the creator should not
		become the creation. Works of art have been detested and destroyed and changed so much by the creator due to us being entrapped in our own minds 
		about what other minds may perceive of it. But why do we do this? Why do we make such a difficult time out of something we should enjoy? Why is it
		that our hearts lay on impression and not expression?</p>
		<p>Because honestly, creation is not worth all that suffering.</p>
		<p>And yet, this is the way it works anyway. Everything goes to our head, the good and the bad. We go through the episodes of frustration, struggle,
		self-torture(in a way), but is it really worth it? Maybe yes, in our eyes as we're bent far over our work, trying relentlessly to make it the best 
		it can be, but in the most rational of thought, it's quite sad isn't it? That something as light-hearted as art and music and inventing can change who
		we are-and in most times, not for the better. Yes, it is sad.</p>
	<article>

		<p>So, to the musicians, creators, inventors, and all those alike, let us end with a scenario. Imagine you're in a room. A serene room. <i>You</i> facing
		yourself in the mirror. You have 60 seconds to prove to yourself what you can do, whether it be through a performance, your newest invention, your artwork,
		etc. And this is the moment-the moment when you either succeed triumphantly, or you fail. One person watching-waiting...The one person who is your biggest 
		critic, even out of a world of seven billion people. This is your moment.

						<li>Don't become too enveloped in your own head. We all tend to overthink.</li>
